## About me

Full-stack developer from Turkey, Tallinn University of Technology - Cybersecurity (BSc | 2023) graduate, that is passionate about technology and has a solid grounding in programming since 2013. Throughout my journey, I've embraced coding as both a hobby and a profession, firmly believing in Mark Twain and Confucius' advice: "Find a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." I appreciate learning new programming languages and tech stacks to expand my horizons and stay on the cutting edge of innovation, and I thrive on lifelong learning.

### Experience

I started programming in 2013 because I was fascinated by computers and technology. I developed a passion for development and quickly mastered the principles of coding by starting with ComputerCraft and lua programming language. My uncle, a computer engineer, served as my inspiration as I committed myself to learning numerous programming languages and frameworks.

### Professional Development

I sought formal education in cyber-security and participated in a number of seminars and courses (Java, C++, Arduino C) to stay up to date with market trends and best practices. I've expanded my knowledge of full-stack development by exploring technologies like React.js, Flutter, and Python thanks to my dedication to learning.

### Soft Skills

In addition to my technical proficiency, I also have good problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills. I support encouraging a collaborative atmosphere where ideas can grow and produce effective solutions. Mission and Vision:
I'm excited to work for an organization that values innovation and is equally as enthusiastic about cutting-edge technologies as I am. In order to develop seamless user experiences and promote corporate success, I hope to contribute my wide skill set. I'm eager to work with like-minded professionals as a team player to produce outstanding outcomes.
